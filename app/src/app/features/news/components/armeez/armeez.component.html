        Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 07 July 2025: Tali Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of stc group, has led a strategic funding round in Tarmeez Capital, one of Saudi’s fastest growing fintech players in the sukuk and debt instruments space—an area playing an increasingly vital role in deepening the Kingdom’s capital markets. This milestone marks the company’s transition from a successfully bootstrapped venture to one backed by a major national investor. The investment supports stc group’s broader strategy to back high-growth digital platforms shaping the future of finance and strengthen the Kingdom’s financial ecosystem.

        Tarmeez Capital, licensed by the Capital Market Authority (CMA), provides end-to-end digital financing services for companies across various sectors. Its Sharia-compliant sukuk products are accessible to both institutional and retail investors. To date, the company has facilitated over SAR 2 billion in financing programs, opened access to over 180,000 users. And over the last year alone, it has grown sukuk issuances by 459 percent. Through leveraging technology, Tarmeez’ digital investment company seamlessly connects finance-seeking businesses with purpose-driven investors.

        In housing and urban development, RASF Real Estate Development is deploying sukuk financing for the Deem project in Al Khobar, a contemporary townhouse complex aimed at the Kingdom’s growing middle class.
